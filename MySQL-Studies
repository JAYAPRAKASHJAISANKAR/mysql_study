What is MySQL?

MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its speed, reliability, and ease of use.
It uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage and manipulate data in a structured way.
Database Basics:

A database is a structured collection of data organized into tables.
Each table consists of rows (also called records) and columns (also called fields) that define the structure of the data.
Connecting to MySQL:

To connect to MySQL, you can use various programming languages like Python, PHP, or simply use the MySQL command-line tool.
Creating a Database:

You can create a new database using the CREATE DATABASE SQL statement.

CREATE DATABASE mydb;
Creating Tables:

Tables are used to store data. You define the structure of a table with the CREATE TABLE statement.

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255)
);
Inserting Data:

To add data to a table, use the INSERT INTO statement.

INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('john_doe', 'john@example.com');
Querying Data:

Use the SELECT statement to retrieve data from tables.

SELECT * FROM users;
Updating Data:

The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data.

UPDATE users SET email = 'new_email@example.com' WHERE id = 1;
Deleting Data:

To remove data from a table, use the DELETE statement.

DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
SQL Joins:

You can combine data from multiple tables using SQL joins (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN).
Indexes:

Indexes can be added to columns for faster data retrieval. Use CREATE INDEX to create them.



-- Creating a new database
CREATE DATABASE mydb;

-- Switching to a database
USE mydb;

-- Creating a table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Inserting data
INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('john_doe', 'john@example.com');

-- Querying data
SELECT * FROM users;

-- Updating data
UPDATE users SET email = 'new_email@example.com' WHERE id = 1;

-- Deleting data
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
Remember, this is just a basic introduction. MySQL is a powerful RDBMS with many advanced features for managing and querying data. As you progress in your studies, you can explore more complex SQL queries, transactions, stored procedures, and database optimization techniques.
