Database Replication and Failover:

Database replication involves creating copies (replicas) of a database for redundancy and load distribution.
Implement replication and failover strategies, such as master-slave replication and automatic failover.
Data Privacy and Compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.):

Compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR and HIPAA is essential.
Demonstrate how to handle sensitive data and implement compliance measures in SQL code.
Database Migration Tools (e.g., AWS DMS):

Migration tools simplify the process of moving databases to different platforms or cloud services.
Explain how to use migration tools and provide examples for migrating to cloud-based databases.
Managing Large Binary Data (BLOBs and CLOBs):

Large binary objects (BLOBs) and character large objects (CLOBs) are used for storing large data like images and documents.
Showcase SQL code for handling and retrieving BLOB/CLOB data efficiently.
Database Connection Pooling:

Connection pooling is crucial for managing database connections efficiently in web applications.
Present code examples in popular programming languages (e.g., Java, Python) that demonstrate connection pooling.
Schema-less Databases (e.g., MongoDB):

Some NoSQL databases, like MongoDB, are schema-less, allowing for flexible data structures.
Explore schema-less data modeling and provide MongoDB code examples.
Database Performance Tuning and Optimization:

Advanced performance tuning techniques can significantly enhance database speed and efficiency.
Offer code snippets and configurations to optimize query performance and server settings.
Code Examples:

Here are SQL code examples and snippets for some of the concepts mentioned above:

Database Replication and Failover (MySQL Master-Slave Replication):

-- Configuring a MySQL master-slave replication setup
-- On the master server
CREATE USER 'replication_user'@'slave_ip' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON _._ TO 'replication_user'@'slave_ip';

-- On the slave server
CHANGE MASTER TO
MASTER_HOST = 'master_ip',
MASTER_USER = 'replication_user',
MASTER_PASSWORD = 'password';
START SLAVE;
Data Privacy and Compliance (Handling Sensitive Data):

-- Anonymizing or pseudonymizing personal data for GDPR compliance
UPDATE customer_data
SET email = CONCAT('user', customer_id, '@example.com');
Database Migration Tools (AWS Database Migration Service - DMS):

-- AWS DMS task definition for migrating a MySQL database to Amazon RDS
-- Define source and target endpoints and replication instance settings
-- Create a replication task to migrate data
Managing Large Binary Data (BLOBs and CLOBs):

-- Storing and retrieving an image in a BLOB column
INSERT INTO images (image_data) VALUES (LOAD_FILE('/path/to/image.jpg'));
SELECT image_data FROM images WHERE image_id = 1;
Database Connection Pooling (Java - Using HikariCP):

// Using HikariCP for database connection pooling in a Java application
HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig();
config.setJdbcUrl("jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydatabase");
config.setUsername("username");
config.setPassword("password");

HikariDataSource dataSource = new HikariDataSource(config);

Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection();
// Use the connection for database operations

connection.close(); // Release the connection back to the pool
Schema-less Databases (MongoDB - Inserting Documents):

// Inserting documents into a MongoDB collection
db.products.insert({
product_id: 1,
product_name: "Widget",
price: 10.99
});
Database Performance Tuning and Optimization (MySQL Query Optimization):

-- Analyzing query execution and optimizing
EXPLAIN SELECT \* FROM orders WHERE order_date >= '2023-01-01';

-- Adding an index for optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_order_date ON orders(order_date);
