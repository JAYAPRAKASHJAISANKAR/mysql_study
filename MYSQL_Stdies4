Database Design Principles:

Effective database design is critical for data integrity and efficiency.
Follow principles like normalization, data modeling, and entity-relationship diagrams (ERD) to create well-structured databases.
NoSQL Databases:

In contrast to relational databases like MySQL, NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB) store data in non-tabular formats.
NoSQL databases are suitable for handling unstructured or semi-structured data and provide scalability advantages.
Database Maintenance:

Regular database maintenance includes tasks like optimizing queries, monitoring performance, and cleaning up old data.
Maintenance routines help keep the database running smoothly.
Database Backup and Recovery Strategies:

Develop comprehensive backup and recovery strategies to protect data against loss or corruption.
Consider strategies like full backups, incremental backups, and point-in-time recovery.
Data Migration:

Data migration involves transferring data from one database to another or from one system to another.
Use tools like MySQL's mysqldump and mysqlimport for efficient data migration.
Database Monitoring and Profiling:

Implement monitoring tools to track database performance and identify bottlenecks.
Profiling helps analyze query execution and optimize for speed.
Database Sharding:

Sharding is a method of horizontal database partitioning to distribute data across multiple servers or databases.
It's used to handle large-scale data and improve performance.
Database High Availability:

Ensure database availability through techniques like failover clustering, replication, and load balancing.
High availability minimizes downtime.
Code Examples:

Here are SQL code examples for some of the concepts mentioned above:

Database Design Principles:

Creating a well-designed database involves creating tables with appropriate relationships. While there's no specific code for design principles, here's an example illustrating table relationships:

-- Creating tables with relationships
CREATE TABLE departments (
department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
department_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
first_name VARCHAR(50),
last_name VARCHAR(50),
department_id INT,
FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)
);
NoSQL Databases:

NoSQL databases have different query languages and data structures. Here's an example of inserting data into a MongoDB NoSQL database:

// Inserting data into a MongoDB collection
db.products.insert({
product_id: 1,
product_name: "Widget",
price: 10.99
});
Database Maintenance:

Regular maintenance tasks often include query optimization and data cleanup. Here's an example of optimizing a MySQL query:

-- Query optimization example
EXPLAIN SELECT \* FROM orders WHERE order_date >= '2023-01-01';
Database Backup and Recovery Strategies:

Creating backups is crucial for data recovery. Here's an example of creating a MySQL database backup using mysqldump:

# Create a MySQL database backup

mysqldump -u username -p database_name > backup.sql
Data Migration:

Migrating data may involve transferring data between databases. Here's an example of importing data into a MySQL database using mysqlimport:

# Import data into a MySQL database

mysqlimport -u username -p database_name data_to_import.csv
Database Monitoring and Profiling:

Monitoring tools help track performance. Profiling SQL queries can be done within MySQL to analyze performance. Here's an example:

-- Enable query profiling
SET profiling = 1;

-- Run your SQL query here

-- Show query profiling results
SHOW PROFILES;
Database Sharding:

Sharding typically involves configuring your database system to distribute data across shards. The specifics depend on the database technology being used.

Database High Availability:

High availability can be achieved through techniques like setting up MySQL replication. Here's a simplified example:

-- Setting up MySQL replication
-- On the master server
CHANGE MASTER TO
MASTER_HOST = 'master_server',
MASTER_USER = 'replication_user',
MASTER_PASSWORD = 'password';

-- On the slave server
START SLAVE;
