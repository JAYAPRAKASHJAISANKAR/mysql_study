SQL Constraints:

Constraints are pivotal rules that uphold the integrity of data within a database. Here are common constraints:

PRIMARY KEY Constraint:

The PRIMARY KEY constraint ensures that each row in a table is unique and serves as an exclusive identifier for that row.

CREATE TABLE employees (
employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
first_name VARCHAR(50),
last_name VARCHAR(50)
);
UNIQUE Constraint:

The UNIQUE constraint guarantees that all values in a column are distinct.

CREATE TABLE customers (
customer_id INT UNIQUE,
customer_name VARCHAR(100)
);
NOT NULL Constraint:

The NOT NULL constraint guarantees that a column cannot contain NULL values.

CREATE TABLE orders (
order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
order_date DATE NOT NULL,
total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
);
CHECK Constraint:

The CHECK constraint enforces specific conditions on a column.

CREATE TABLE products (
product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
product_name VARCHAR(100),
unit_price DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (unit_price > 0)
);
FOREIGN KEY Constraint:

The FOREIGN KEY constraint connects a column to a primary key in another table, ensuring referential integrity.

CREATE TABLE orders (
order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
customer_id INT,
order_date DATE,
FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);
Transactions:

A transaction represents a series of SQL statements executed as a single, cohesive unit of work. Transactions guarantee that database operations adhere to the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

To manage transactions, use the following commands:

BEGIN: Initiates a transaction.
COMMIT: Finalizes and applies the transaction.
ROLLBACK: Undoes the transaction, returning to the previous state.
Views:

Views are virtual tables derived from SELECT queries. They simplify complex queries and regulate access to specific data. Views do not store data; they are saved queries.

Stored Procedures:

Stored procedures are precompiled collections of one or more SQL statements. They are stored within the database and can be executed with a single call. Stored procedures enhance code reusability, security, and performance.

Triggers:

Triggers are database objects that automatically execute in response to specific events (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). They serve to enforce business rules or audit changes in the database.

Normalization:

Database normalization organizes data to minimize redundancy. Various normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, etc.) guide this process, ensuring data integrity.

Indexing:

Indexes enhance database performance by facilitating swift access to rows based on values in one or more columns. Selecting the right columns to index is crucial for optimizing query performance.

Backup and Recovery:

To safeguard against data loss due to hardware failures, errors, or corruption, regularly backup your database. MySQL offers multiple backup methods, including mysqldump and binary backups.

Security:

Implement robust security measures to protect your database. This includes using strong passwords, restricting user privileges, and regularly updating MySQL and server software to address security vulnerabilities.

Scaling and Replication:

As your application grows, consider scaling techniques like replication to distribute workloads and boost availability. Replication involves real-time data copying from one database to another.
